## Why did i create this page?

There is more than one thing i try to accomplish. I am a STEM college student and this site will be the way I publish my personal projects. These projects include doing web design and hands on Raspberry Pi homelab experiences. New projects will always be added to the following list.

### Webdesign
In todays world the most comfortable way of expressing ones self is by maintaining a personal web blog. In order to have it viewable without visual cluttering the design phase of a website is essential practise. This Github Pages site is going to be the starting point of my career in webdesign where projects will be documented and presented. The information serves as a documentation for myself and a guide for those who aspire to do the same thing!

### Raspberry Pi Projects
For anybody who is unfamiliar with Raspberry Pi:
The Raspberry Pi is a small SBC (single board computer) whose intented purpose was to bring IT related topics closer to schools.

Nowadays people created amazing projects using the RPi utilizing it as a microcontroller. However, I will use it exactly as its intended; creating a small homelab to learn networking and administration of IT systems.

### Photography & Editing
I bought myself a sony alpha 6000 camera which will (hopefully) create beautiful images of everyday things and of traveling. The photos I really like will end up on this website. I still need to find a favored programm and practise for the editing. So you won't see anything here soon.

### Pesonal Portfolio
A website serving as a personal portfolio.
